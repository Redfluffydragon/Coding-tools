# Coding Tools

Just a few somewhat useful coding tools, all in one place.

Plus I wanted to make my own color picker, to learn more about color spaces and stuff. I've since forgotten most of it.

Actually, this was mostly because I wanted to make a color picker, and I thought I'd throw in some other simple stuff.

keyCode is now deprecated, but it wasn't when I made this, so I'm leaving it there.
